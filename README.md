- Raspberry Pi code
- Environment variables
- Requirements to install using pip

[`Raspberry Pi Documentation`](Raspberry%20Pi/docs/Raspberry_Pi_Documentation.md)

This document explains the setup, configuration, and usage of the Raspberry Pi within the HydroSim system.

## Siemens PLC (TIA Portal)

This branch contains a folder with:
- A **Siemens PLC TIA Portal `.zap` project file**
