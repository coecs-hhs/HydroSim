# Operational Technology Simulation System

## Overview

This project integrates EPANET, OpenPLC, and ScadaLTS to create a comprehensive simulation environment for operational technology (OT) systems, with a focus on water networks.

## Components

### EPANET
Simulates water distribution systems, providing a digital twin of the water network.

### OpenPLC
Acts as the programmable logic controller, interfacing with the EPANET simulation to read sensor data and execute control logic.

### ScadaLTS
Provides the human-machine interface (HMI) for visualization and interaction with the simulated system.

### Opensearch
Retrieves logs from the 2 webservers: 
1. Wordpress with RCE vulnerability
2. ScadaLTS with privilege escalation and RCE

## Features

- Realistic simulation of water network behavior
- Real-time control logic execution
- User-friendly HMI for system monitoring and control
- Scenario testing and analysis capabilities
- Students training in a safe, simulated environment

## Requirements
- docker compose

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/coecs-hhs/HydroSim
cd HydroSim
sudo docker compose up -d
```
